# LogOutButton
LogOutButton is a GNOME Shell extension that shows a log out button next to the
power-off, lock and settings buttons in the system action list.

## Install
Building LogOutButton from source requires:

 - Glib development files (`libglib2.0-dev`)
 - `gettext`

To install run:

    $ sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev gettext
    $ ./install.sh local-install

You may need to restart GNOME (Alt + F2, r) before you see LogOutButton in your
list of extensions
